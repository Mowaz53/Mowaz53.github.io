      <p class="timeline-text-custom"> <b>Work Description</b> <br>
      <p> Under Dr. Caroline L. Noblet’s (Associate Professor, UMaine School of Economics) supervision, I work on experimental environmental economics research on how people interpret and respond to PFAS contamination, focusing on public awareness, risk perception, and behavioral impacts on rural resilience and Maine’s food systems. The project is part of an interdisciplinary team recognized with the 2024 Research Collaboration Award from UMaine’s College of Earth, Life, and Health Sciences.
<br> <br>
I am also working with Dr Keith S. Evans and Dr. Caroline Noblet to contribute to research aimed at expanding market opportunities for Maine’s marine aquaculture industry. The research prioritizes aquaculture supply chains, identifying seafood market barriers, and analyzing consumer preferences to to guide industry strategy and policy for Maine’s coastal economy.
