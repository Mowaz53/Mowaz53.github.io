        Hi good people! Welcome to My Site!

      </p>

      <p>
        This is Mir Rafiul Ahmed. Currently, I am working as a Graduate Teaching Assistant in School of Economics, University of Maine. Prior to that, I worked as a Senior Research Assistant in one of the leading economic
        research institutes of Bangladesh, South Asian Networking on Economic Modeling (SANEM). </p>
      <p> I am a diligent Economics graduate student with a flair for creative thinking and a strong work ethic,
        possess compelling analytical and research-driven abilities, coupled with concise communication skills for
        effective presentations with proficiency in digital content creation, aiming to establish a fulfilling
        career in academia and policymaking while actively contributing to development </p>

      <p>
        I am now pursuing my Master's in Economics under the School of Economics, University of Maine. My journey in the world of economics began with a deep curiosity about the forces that shape our societies, and it has led me to where I am todayâ€”a passionate researcher committed to making a difference through knowledge and policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have completed my Bachelor of Social Science in Economics from Shahjalal University of Science and
        Technology, Sylhet, Bangladesh in May 2023. I worked under Mr. Gias Uddin Khan, Associate Professor, SUST
        for my final year project for 6 months from July 2022 to December 2023.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to joining SANEM, I have also worked on different research projects for the SUST Research Center.
        Apart from that, I have also worked as a Research Intern in SANEM.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also initiated Econ Insider and worked as a founding executive director. Econ Insider is a
        non-partisan youth-led organisation for economics enthusiasts with a motive to drive young minds towards
        economic research through arranging economic discussions, workshops and contests.
