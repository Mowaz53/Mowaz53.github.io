    Expanding Market Opportunities for Maine’s Marine Aquaculture Industry [Spring 2024 – Spring 2025]
  </h4>
  <p class="timeline-text-custom">
    As part of a NOAA-funded research initiative, this project investigates market pathways, supply chain dynamics, and consumer preferences 
    to enhance the economic viability of Maine’s marine aquaculture sector. The study focuses on identifying strategic opportunities to 
    increase market penetration for farmed seafood products while addressing existing barriers across distribution and consumer awareness. 
    I work with Dr. Keith S. Evans and Dr. Caroline L. Noblet at the University of Maine to support research activities including data 
    analysis, literature review, and stakeholder communication to inform actionable policy and industry strategies for Maine’s coastal economy.

          Assessing Maine Hunters’ Behavior in the Time of PFAS [Fall 2024 – Fall 2026]
        </a>
      </h4>
      <p class="timeline-text-custom">
        This study is facilitated by the Maine Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Department (MDIFW) where I have worked as a graduate research assistant under Dr Caroline Noblet and Dr Dianne Kopec.
      This project evaluates how the behaviors of Maine hunters may change due to concerns regarding the presence of environmental contaminants such as PFAS in wildlife. The team will survey hunters who hold a Maine hunting license (residents and non-residents)
        assess their current knowledge and concerns about contaminants in wildlife, as well as test the effectiveness of messages associated with hunting advisories.      </p>

          Assessing Maine’s Anglers’ Preferences for Fish Consumption [Fall 2024 – Summer 2025]
        </a>
      </h4>
      <p class="timeline-text-custom">
      
  This project will assess the fish consumption habits of Maine freshwater anglers, particularly fish consumption rates, facilitated by the Maine Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Department (MDIFW).
        This information is considered by the Maine Center for Disease Control in assessing the need and scope of fish consumption advisories and is the impetus for conducting this research survey.
